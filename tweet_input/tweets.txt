Celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian on Thursday said he was pulling the plug on a restaurant at Donald Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel over the Republican presidential candidate's comments about Mexican immigrants. Zakarian Hospitality employs many immigrants from nations all over the world, and I look forward to continuing this business culture in my future restaurants," he said. "We are a nation built from immigrants, my family included." Zakarian is chef and partner at The Lambs Club in New York City as well as an author. He is a host on the Food Network program "The Kitchen" and has appeared on "Chopped" and "Iron Chef America."
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Thursday signed into law a measure to remove the contentious Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol, the culmination of a years-long movement that was reignited by the murders of nine members of a historically black church in Charleston.

Before adding her signature to the legislation, Haley spoke of the black victims, who were killed by a white man after they welcomed him into a June 17 prayer meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Church.

Their act of love and faith, Haley said, set into motion a chain of events that led to the flag's removal less than a month later.

"May we never forget the actions that those people took to get us to this point today," the governor said.

Haley noted that when the confessed killer, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, was caught, relatives of the victims said in court that they forgave him. That act of forgiveness, Haley said, sparked a wave of compassion around the country that motivated people to change things.

In the days after the shootings, photos emerged of Roof posing with the Confederate flag, a Civil War relic that is also seen as an emblem of racism. That sparked a nationwide debate about the flag's place in American culture. Many businesses stopped making and selling the flag and its images, and public officials discussed removing the flag from public grounds.

Their act of love and faith, Haley said, set into motion a chain of events that led to the flag's removal less than a month later.

"May we never forget the actions that those people took to get us to this point today," the governor said.

Haley noted that when the confessed killer, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, was caught, relatives of the victims said in court that they forgave him. That act of forgiveness, Haley said, sparked a wave of compassion around the country that motivated people to change things.

In the days after the shootings, photos emerged of Roof posing with the Confederate flag, a Civil War relic that is also seen as an emblem of racism. That sparked a nationwide debate about the flag's place in American culture. Many businesses stopped making and selling the flag and its images, and public officials discussed removing the flag from public grounds.

The checkout pages on shopping sites are getting more crowded, so American Express is creating its own real estate.

The credit card company today is introducing Amex Express Checkout, an alternative payment method its card members can use to more easily check out and pay on partnering websites and apps from merchants such as Ticketmaster, Newegg and Warby Parker.

American Express cardholders enter their usernames and passwords from their online Amex accounts and the tool auto-fills their payment information into the billing and shipping fields.

The move comes as tech companies like Google and PayPal and credit card competitors Visa and MasterCard are competing to own the Buy button on websites and apps. As e-commerce continues to grow significantly faster than offline retail, these companies are vying to make checking out easier on shopping sites, whether on desktop computers or mobile phones.

The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps.

Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs. "It appears the company pursued debt collection actions against consumers using information that was inaccurate, had been misreported, or was just plain false," acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in the statement. Also, Chase was alleged to have engaged in inaccurate credit reporting, which had the potential to cause consumers future difficulty in obtaining housing, employment, credit and insurance, the statement said. In certain instances, Chase sold to debt buyers credit-card accounts that were inaccurate, settled, discharged in bankruptcy, not owed by the consumer or otherwise uncollectable, according to the settlement. "We are pleased to resolve these legacy issues and are working to complete our remediation of affected credit card customers,'' a Chase spokesman said in an emailed statement. In a press release, Chase said the agreement "covers issues from several years ago for a small percentage of credit-card customers who defaulted on their credit-card debt" and that it had "stopped filing credit-card collections litigation in 2011 and has not restarted.'' The lender said it has "dismissed the impacted lawsuits'' and "improved its debt sales processes.'' The consumers who will no longer face collections action from Chase are those who received judgments against them between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Under the settlement, Chase will notify the borrowers of its decision to halt collections activity, and will request that all three major credit reporting agencies not report the judgments.

The consumers who will no longer face collections action from Chase are those who received judgments against them between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Under the settlement, Chase will notify the borrowers of its decision to halt collections activity, and will request that all three major credit reporting agencies not report the judgments.

The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps. The checkout pages on shopping sites are getting more crowded, so American Express is creating its own real estate. The credit card company today is introducing Amex Express Checkout, an alternative payment method its card members can use to more easily check out and pay on partnering websites and apps from merchants such as Ticketmaster, Newegg and Warby Parker. American Express cardholders enter their usernames and passwords from their online Amex accounts and the tool auto-fills their payment information into the billing and shipping fields. The move comes as tech companies like Google and PayPal and credit card competitors Visa and MasterCard are competing to own the Buy button on websites and apps. As e-commerce continues to grow significantly faster than offline retail, these companies are vying to make checking out easier on shopping sites, whether on desktop computers or mobile phones.The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps. Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs. "It appears the company pursued debt collection actions against consumers using information that was inaccurate, had been misreported, or was just plain false," acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in the statement. Also, Chase was alleged to have engaged in inaccurate credit reporting, which had the potential to cause consumers future difficulty in obtaining housing, employment, credit and insurance, the statement said. In certain instances, Chase sold to debt buyers credit-card accounts that were inaccurate, settled, discharged in bankruptcy, not owed by the consumer or otherwise uncollectable, according to the settlement. "We are pleased to resolve these legacy issues and are working to complete our remediation of affected credit card customers,'' a Chase spokesman said in an emailed statement. In a press release, Chase said the agreement "covers issues from several years ago for a small percentage of credit-card customers who defaulted on their credit-card debt" and that it had "stopped filing credit-card collections litigation in 2011 and has not restarted.''

The consumers who will no longer face collections action from Chase are those who received judgments against them between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Under the settlement, Chase will notify the borrowers of its decision to halt collections activity, and will request that all three major credit reporting agencies not report the judgments.

The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps. The checkout pages on shopping sites are getting more crowded, so American Express is creating its own real estate. The credit card company today is introducing Amex Express Checkout, an alternative payment method its card members can use to more easily check out and pay on partnering websites and apps from merchants such as Ticketmaster, Newegg and Warby Parker. American Express cardholders enter their usernames and passwords from their online Amex accounts and the tool auto-fills their payment information into the billing and shipping fields. The move comes as tech companies like Google and PayPal and credit card competitors Visa and MasterCard are competing to own the Buy button on websites and apps. As e-commerce continues to grow significantly faster than offline retail, these companies are vying to make checking out easier on shopping sites, whether on desktop computers or mobile phones.The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps. Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs. "It appears the company pursued debt collection actions against consumers using information that was inaccurate, had been misreported, or was just plain false," acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in the statement. Also, Chase was alleged to have engaged in inaccurate credit reporting, which had the potential to cause consumers future difficulty in obtaining housing, employment, credit and insurance, the statement said. In certain instances, Chase sold to debt buyers credit-card accounts that were inaccurate, settled, discharged in bankruptcy, not owed by the consumer or otherwise uncollectable, according to the settlement. "We are pleased to resolve these legacy issues and are working to complete our remediation of affected credit card customers,'' a Chase spokesman said in an emailed statement.

The consumers who will no longer face collections action from Chase are those who received judgments against them between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Under the settlement, Chase will notify the borrowers of its decision to halt collections activity, and will request that all three major credit reporting agencies not report the judgments.

The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates. Even Apple is trying to solve this problem, with the launch last fall of its Apple Pay buttons for mobile apps. The checkout pages on shopping sites are getting more crowded, so American Express is creating its own real estate. The credit card company today is introducing Amex Express Checkout, an alternative payment method its card members can use to more easily check out and pay on partnering websites and apps from merchants such as Ticketmaster, Newegg and Warby Parker. American Express cardholders enter their usernames and passwords from their online Amex accounts and the tool auto-fills their payment information into the billing and shipping fields. The move comes as tech companies like Google and PayPal and credit card competitors Visa and MasterCard are competing to own the Buy button on websites and apps. As e-commerce continues to grow significantly faster than offline retail, these companies are vying to make checking out easier on shopping sites, whether on desktop computers or mobile phones.The competition is especially hot in mobile commerce where the nuisance of entering payment, billing and shipping details on small screens leads to lower purchase rates.

Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs. "It appears the company pursued debt collection actions against consumers using information that was inaccurate, had been misreported, or was just plain false," acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in the statement. Also, Chase was alleged to have engaged in inaccurate credit reporting, which had the potential to cause consumers future difficulty in obtaining housing, employment, credit and insurance, the statement said. In certain instances, Chase sold to debt buyers credit-card accounts that were inaccurate, settled, discharged in bankruptcy, not owed by the consumer or otherwise uncollectable, according to the settlement.

Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs.

Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs.

The consumers who will no longer face collections action from Chase are those who received judgments against them between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Under the settlement, Chase will notify the borrowers of its decision to halt collections activity, and will request that all three major credit reporting agencies not report the judgments.

Financial Protection Bureau, Chase must reform its debt collection practices, and collections efforts against more than 528,000 consumers, including 34,000 in New Jersey, will be halted. The settlement with Chase Bank USA and Chase Bankcard Services Inc. comes after the JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries were accused of using "robo-signed" affidavits from staffers who had not authenticated the information when creating debt-collection lawsuits against consumers. The affidavits included inaccurate information and calculation errors that resulted in judgments against consumers for more money than they actually owed and subjected some consumers to collections on accounts that were not theirs. "It appears the company pursued debt collection actions against consumers using information that was inaccurate, had been misreported, or was just plain false," acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in the statement. Also, Chase was alleged to have engaged in inaccurate credit reporting, which had the potential to cause consumers future difficulty in obtaining housing, employment, credit and insurance, the statement said. In certain instances, Chase sold to debt buyers credit-card accounts that were inaccurate, settled, discharged in bankruptcy, not owed by the consumer or otherwise uncollectable, according to the settlement.

1 Novak Djokovic will play Frenchman Richard Gasquet in the opening men's semifinal at Wimbledon on Friday, which starts around 5 a.m. PDT, and many here will consider it the perfect warmup act. Related Garbine Muguruza beats Agnieszka Radwanska to reach Wimbledon final SPORTS Garbine Muguruza beats Agnieszka Radwanska to reach Wimbledon final EE ALL RELATED In that match will be Roger Federer, who grew to stardom here. He is as close to getting honorary British citizenship as anybody ever from Switzerland. He has won major tournaments 17 times and this one seven. One more title here will set a record. But then, there is that Andy Murray fellow on the other side of the net. He is from Scotland, so blood and loyalty, perhaps even the wishes of the queen, dictate that Murray be rooted home. Plus, he is as popular an athlete as there is in the United Kingdom. Djokovic is playing well, is the defending champion and is coached by a man who knows what to tell him as he goes into these final crucial matches. Boris Becker won three Wimbledon titles, his first 30 years ago. Djokovic has won twice here. Djokovic beat Federer in last year's final and is almost even with him in their career head-to-heads. Were they both to reach the final, a Djokovic victory would make them 20-20. Gasquet, who is seeded 21st, has only beaten Djokovic once in 12 matches and that was in 2007. Gasquet ruined Djokovic's chance for revenge after his French Open final loss to Stan Wawrinka when the Frenchman beat Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. Serena Williams defeats Maria Sharapova to advance to Wimbledon fina Serena Williams defeats Maria Sharapova to advance to Wimbledon final Federer and Murray have quite a history, making Friday's second semifinal a dramatic pick-'em. Federer is seeded second, Murray third. Federer leads in their to-head series, 12-11. In 2012, Federer beat Murray in the Wimbledon final — his most recent Grand Slam title. But in the London Olympics that year, Murray beat Federer in the gold medal match. To get to that final, Murray defeated Djokovic in the semifinals. Murray had been previously included in the list of the men's game's Big Four, and he really confirmed his spot after that, winning the U.S. Open in 2012 and becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon title in 77 years in 2013. Federer has never lost a semifinal at Wimbledon. Djokovic's victory over Federer in last year's final was a five-set thriller.
